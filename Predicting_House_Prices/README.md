Project Description
A simple machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and more.

Steps
Data Exploration

Explore the dataset to understand its structure
Check for missing values
Gain insights into the distribution of house prices and features
Data Preprocessing

Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers
Convert categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding for neighborhoods)
Feature Selection

Choose relevant features that may impact house prices
Model Selection

Select the most suitable algorithm using cross-validation technique
Data Split

Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set
Model Training

Train the chosen regression model on the training data
Use the selected features as input and house prices as the target variable
Model Ensemble

Ensemble the highest two algorithms in R2-score using voting regressor
Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like R2-score
Prediction

Use the trained model to make house price predictions for new data points or hypothetical scenarios
Model Tuning

Experiment with different hyperparameters of the regression model to improve its predictive accuracy
